> Right click context menu actions for the Dolphin file manager which make it easy to quickly add files to Hydrus.
Sends the selected files/directories/archives to Hydrus, with user defined tags. It works recursively (files in subdirectories will also be found, etc).
By default it also extracts archives and sends their contents instead of the archive files themselves. It does this recursively too.
It does not delete any files and there is a confirmation dialog with a list of files before the files are sent to Hydrus.

[Server container for Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/mtbl/hydrus-server-docker)
> This is a simple Debian-based Docker setup for running hydrus server from source.
