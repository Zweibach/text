# Downloading files
[Back to table of contents](00_tableOfContents.md)

Start with opening a downloader page. Ctrl+T, double-clicking the tab bar, or navigating down `pages -> new download page` from the toolbar. Depending on what you want to download pick either: URL download if you have a bunch of tabs or bookmarks of image posts or just a big list of URLs. Watcher if you're on chans and want to scrape threads. Gallery if you want to download things with a specific tag from a booru/Pixiv/other gallery site, or an artist on Twitter/Pixiv/Artstation/Deviantart/etc.  
For keeping up to date with a query (aka subscribing to a query) there's subscriptions found under `network -> manage subscriptions`.

There's some commonalites to all downloaders. File import options are available to all downloaders. Tag import options are available to all except the simple downloader. Look over your options, especially the tag import options as by default Hydrus will not parse/import tags.

All downloader pages have gallery logs, the button looks like a tiny window with three columns of lines, hovering over it should display the text `open detailed gallery log--right-click for quick actions, if applicable`. These are useful for retrying failed downloads and troubleshooting as the reason for failure is stated here.

As with [importing files](02_importAndExport.md), Hydrus will not import exact duplicate files and unless explicitly told to, will not import previously deleted files. Same thing with known URLs.

If you want to download from a site that is not supported by Hydrus by default there's a community managed repository of downloader objetcs found on [Github](https://github.com/CuddleBear92/Hydrus-Presets-and-Scripts). Just download the corresponding .png and drag them into the import window found under `network -> downloaders -> import downloaders`.  
If there are none to be found it's not hard to make one yourself following the guide in the [help documents](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/help/downloader_intro.html).
