The API enables external programs to access Hydrus.

## Enabling API
To use the API you must first turn it on.

To turn on the API you have to navigate down `services -> manage services` and find the `client api`, should be at the top of the list. Open it and uncheck the box labeled `do not run client api service`.

Take a moment to look at the options available here. Most of them have a tooltip if you hover the text.

## Generating an API key
Next step is to generate an API key. This is what external programs use to authenticate themselves to Hydrus.

Navigate to `services -> review services` and look for a tab labeled `client api`.
